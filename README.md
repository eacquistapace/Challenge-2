# Challenge-2

**Main Objective**

Created a portfolio page that displayed 3 main sections, including: About Me, My Projects, and Contact Me.

Created a HTML, reset CSS stylesheet, and CSS stylesheet.

**HTML**

Used semantic elements in HTML in order to provide clarity to anyone viewing code.

Provided alt properties for any image included.

Indented properly and included spaces between code for better readability.

Made use of ids and classes.

**CSS**

Reset CSS stylesheet provided by the public domain document from MeyerWeb.

Made use of flexbox properties and tried out new methods- some worked, some did not.

Navigation bar scrolls to corresponding sections while reacting to clicks.

Application link reacts to the user then deploys when proper link is clicked on in 'My Projects' section.

When the page is resized to 768px, elements on the page will change accordingly.

Simplified code as much as possible to avoid repeating rules.

**Additional Notes**

When resizing page to 768px, the section boxes respond correctly but I could not get the header to resize. I will put more research into why this was happening.

Was worried that I may have used flexbox properties incorrectly, but hopefully with more practice I can learn what works and when to use it.
