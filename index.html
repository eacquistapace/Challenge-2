                Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ellen, and I am learning web development for the first time. I look forward to the challenges and excitement of coding! In my free time I am either hanging out with my two cats- Finn and Seamus, playing video games, or watching anime. I look forward to working with you!

                In the file to the left, you will find my most recent application that I have worked on in my University of Denver coding bootcamp. I hope to expand my portfolio as I learn more and be able to present you with more complete, complex, and organized code.
